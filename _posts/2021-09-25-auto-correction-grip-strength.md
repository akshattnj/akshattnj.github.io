description: Developing a system for robotic prosthetics that dynamically adjusts grip strength based on object characteristics to enhance safety and utility.
---

Traditional robotic prosthetics often lack the ability to adjust grip strength based on the object they handle, leading to breakages or insufficient grip. This project employs pressure sensors and machine-learning algorithms to create a system that adapts in real-time to various textures and weights. The prosthetic can distinguish between delicate and sturdy objects, significantly improving handling precision and reducing incidents of damage by 50%.

### Background
Traditional robotic prosthetics often lack the sensitivity needed to differentiate between varying object textures and weights, leading to either insufficient grip or excessive force that can crush items.

### Technology Implementation
Using pressure sensors embedded in the prosthetic fingers and a microcontroller with a machine-learning algorithm, the system learns optimal grip patterns based on real-time feedback.

### Testing and Results
Trials with users showed a 50% reduction in object damage incidents. The prosthetic also adapted to diverse objects like eggs, cups, and tools without manual adjustments.

### Future Scope
Further development will include integrating neural feedback loops to enhance the response time and adaptability of the system, making it more intuitive for users.
