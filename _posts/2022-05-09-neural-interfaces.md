description: Research into non-invasive neural interfaces for controlling devices and systems through brain activity, enhancing hands-free operation.
---

This project focuses on developing non-invasive neural interfaces using EEG technology. The aim is to translate brain activity into machine commands, enabling hands-free control of devices such as robotic limbs, industrial machinery, and virtual environments. By leveraging machine learning to interpret neural patterns, the system achieves an 80% accuracy rate in translating motor commands, demonstrating the potential for broader applications in assistive technology and immersive gaming.

### Objective
The goal is to create a seamless interface that does not require invasive implants, using technologies such as electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

### Methods
The system processes brain signals through advanced algorithms that detect specific patterns associated with motor commands or intent. A real-time processor translates these patterns into actions, allowing for hands-free control.

### Challenges
Noise interference and signal variability between users remain significant hurdles. However, ongoing machine-learning integration has shown promise in increasing the systemâ€™s accuracy rate by up to 80%.

### Applications
Beyond medical use, this technology could enhance virtual and augmented reality experiences and enable hands-free operation of machines in industrial settings.
